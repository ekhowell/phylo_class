# Phylogenetics Final Report Reproducible Script
#### By: Emma Howell
#### Last Updated: 4/24/21
Purpose: To record steps in phylogenetic analysis of PRDM9 locus in house mouse subspecies complex.

## Note
This README will include all the steps necessary to recreate this analysis. However, all of the required files/data are contained within this repository so there is no need to re-download VCF files or re-fetch GTF and reference files from UCSC's Table Browser.

## Installing Software
Required software: vcftools, bcftools, tabix, MUSCLE, and IQ-TREE.

A conda environment will be used to install/manage the packages used in this analysis. Follow the steps below to install Miniconda.

The subsequent sections provides the commands used to install the required software. For those wishing to generate an exact replica of the conda environment used here, the YAML file "phylo_project_env.yml" in the packages directory provides and alternative to the individual installation steps.

This command will build a conda environment from the YAML file.
```
conda env create --file phylo_project_env.yml
```

#### Installing Miniconda
Follow the instructions provided here to install Miniconda: 

For MacOS users, Miniconda can be installed with a few short commands.

Download Miniconda.
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Run the Miniconda installer and follow the prompts.
```
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

#### Creating Conda Environment
Run this command to create a new conda environment called "phylo_project" within which we can install the necessary software.
```
conda create --name phylo_project python=3.8
```

Then, activate the conda environment.
```
source activate phylo_project
```
Now we can install the software needed for this project. This includes `vcftools`, `bcftools`, and `tabix` to manipulate the VCF input files. The software needed for the phylogenetic analysis includes `muscle` and `iq-tree`.

First, install the software for working with the input files.
```
conda install vcftools
conda install bcftools
conda install tabix
```
Next, install the software for the phylogenetic analyses
```
conda install muscle
conda install -c bioconda iqtree
```

In order to ensure reproducibility of this analysis, I will package this conda environment into the phylo_project_env.yml file that can be found in the packages directory.

Here is the command used to package my conda environment.
```
conda env export --name phylo_project_test > phylo_project_env.yml
```

In order to ensure that the conda environment is consistent for other users, those wanting an alternative to installing software separately can simply run the following command to generate a replica environment from the provided YAML file.
```
conda env create --file phylo_project_env.yml
```

Activate the environment by running the following command.
```
source activate phylo_project
```

## Step 1: Get Wild Mouse Genomes
Go here to download the VCF file containing the filtered SNPs of the wild mouse samples (Warning: LARGE)
http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~evolbio/evolgen/wildmouse/vcf/
Download the files named "AllMouse.vcf_90_recalibrated_snps_raw_indels_reheader_PopSorted.PASS.vcf.gz" and "AllMouse.vcf_90_recalibrated_snps_raw_indels_reheader_PopSorted.PASS.vcf.gz.tbi"

## Step 2: Get Genomic Coordinates of PRDM9 Locus
Next, we need a file that tells us what region of the house mouse genome (build mm10) contains the PRDM9 CDS. We can do this using the UCSC Genome Table Browser. This will give us a GTF file for PRDM9 in the mm10 reference genome. The entries into the Table Browser should be filled out like this:
https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?position=chr17:15543072-15563331&hgsid=1075670165_3pAqvF1yoQSPd61qGTSNji15a0MT&refGene=pack&refGene_sel=1&refSeqComposite_sel=1&hgFind.matches=NM_144809,
Download the output file as "mm10_prdm9_ncbi_refseq_gtf.txt"

The top of the file should look like this:
```
chr17   mm10_ncbiRefSeq stop_codon      15543973        15543975        0.000000        -       .       gene_id "XM_006523988.3"

chr17   mm10_ncbiRefSeq CDS     15554688        15554755        0.000000        -       0       gene_id "XM_006523988.3"; transc

chr17   mm10_ncbiRefSeq CDS     15555087        15555358        0.000000        -       2       gene_id "XM_006523988.3"; transc
chr17   mm10_ncbiRefSeq exon    15555087        15555358        0.000000        -       .       gene_id "XM_006523988.3"; transc
chr17   mm10_ncbiRefSeq CDS     15555566        15555667        0.000000        -       2       gene_id "XM_006523988.3"; transc
```
We only want the features labeled NM_144809.2 because this is the accession number for the PRDM9 CDS reference sequence. We also need to convert this GTF file into BED file format (only need the CHROM, START, and STOP columns) in order to intersect these genomic coordinates with the records in the VCF file. To do this, we can use the following command:
`cat mm10_prdm9_ncbi_refseq_gtf.txt | grep "NM_144809.2" | grep "CDS" | cut -f1,4,5 > mm10_prdm9_ncbi_refseq_gtf.bed`

Now, you should have a file that looks like this:
```
chr17	15543976	15545360
chr17	15553352	15553545
chr17	15554688	15554755
chr17	15555087	15555358
chr17	15555566	15555667
chr17	15557301	15557457
chr17	15559023	15559072
chr17	15562415	15562522
chr17	15562814	15562937
chr17	15563221	15563301
```

## Step 3: Extract PRDM9 Variants from Whole Genomes
Now that we have a list of the genomic intervals that contain the PRDM9 CDS, we can use this to pull out SNPs in the house mouse genomes that are falling within these intervals.

This vcftools command will output a new VCF file containing only SNPs falling within the regions specified by the BED file:
`vcftools --gzvcf AllMouse.vcf_90_recalibrated_snps_raw_indels_reheader_PopSorted.PASS.vcf.gz --bed mm10_prdm9_ncbi_refseq_gtf.bed --recode --out PRDM9_CDS_AllMouse.vcf_90_recalibrated_snps_raw_indels_reheader_PopSorted.PASS`

Go ahead and compress/index this new VCF using the following commands.
```
bgzip -c PRDM9_CDS_AllMouse.vcf_90_recalibrated_snps_raw_indels_reheader_PopSorted.PASS.recode.vcf > PRDM9_CDS_AllMouse.vcf_90_recalibrated_snps_raw_indels_reheader_PopSorted.PASS.recode.vcf.gz
tabix -p vcf PRDM9_CDS_AllMouse.vcf_90_recalibrated_snps_raw_indels_reheader_PopSorted.PASS.recode.vcf.gz 
```

## Step 4: Convert VCF to FASTA
Now we have the variants that overlap our PRDM9 locus, but in order to do a multiple sequence alignment, we need *sequences* in FASTA format, not *variants* in VCF format.

This really just means that we need to "fill in" the space between our variant sites with whatever nucleotide is present in the mm10 reference genome. To do this, we will use the bcftools *consensus* command.

But first, we need a FASTA file that contains our reference sequence for the chunk of genome that is contained within our PRDM9 VCF. To get this reference FASTA, we need to go back to UCSC's Table Browser and this time get the reference sequence for PRDM9's CDS. 

The entries into the Table Browser form should look like this:
https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?position=chr17:15543072-15563331&hgsid=1077666803_GdXWz7q9AFAzAPVn9dyr5U7dGFVx&refGene=pack&refGene_sel=1&refSeqComposite_sel=1&hgFind.matches=NM_144809,
Make sure the following options are selected in the next window:
https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=1077666803_GdXWz7q9AFAzAPVn9dyr5U7dGFVx&hgta_geneSeqType=genomic&hgta_doGenePredSequence=submit
Download the output file as "mm10_prdm9_reference_sequence.fa".

The top of the FASTA file should look something like this:
```
>mm10_ncbiRefSeq_XM_006523988.3_0 range=chr17:15563221-15563301 5'pad=0 3'pad=0 strand=- repeatMasking=none

>mm10_ncbiRefSeq_XM_006523988.3_1 range=chr17:15562814-15562937 5'pad=0 3'pad=0 strand=- repeatMasking=none

GTCTCAGAGCCCCTAGACCAGCTTTCATGTGTTACCAAAGGCAAGCAATG
AAACCCCAAATAAATGACAGTGAGGATTCTGATGAAGAGTGGACACCTAA
GCAACAAG
```

Much like with the GTF file, we only want the FASTA records that correspond to the accession number "NM_144809.2". With one record for each exon in the CDS, this should equate to a total of **10** records with the accession number "NM_144809.2" in the header. 

Unfortunately, there's no straightforward way that I've tried yet to automatically extract these specific records [TO DO]. So instead, open up nano and delete the records that do not contain "NM_144809.2" in the header. 

While you're at it, you need to alter the content of the remaining headers so that they are in the format:
`>chr:start-stop`
If the FASTA records for each exon are not in this format in the reference, then bcftools will not be able to recognize them as genomic coordinates when we are converting out VCF to FASTA. Again, there is no better way to do this yet than to just open nano and fix it [TO DO].

(Note: For an edited version of this file, see the refs/ directory). At the end of all this, your new mm10_prdm9_reference_sequence.fa should look like this:
```
>chr17 15543973-15545360

GCAATATTTCAGTGATAAGTCAAATGTCAATGAGCACCAGAAGACACACA
```

Now that we have the reference sequence, we can drop in the variants from our VCF file for each sample in order to create a "consensus" FASTA for each of our sequences. Here is the structure of the bcftools command:
`bcftools consensus -f reference.fa -s sample_name -o output.fa vcf_file.vcf.gz`
Note how we need to specify *which* sample we want to create the FASTA for. This means that this command must be run for *each* sample using the names contained within the VCF file. 

From Harr et al. (2016), here are the names and subpopulation affiliation for each of the sequences contained within the VCF file:
```

```

Instead of running the bcftools command an million times, I've thrown those IDs into a list and put the command in a for loop. This "get_fasta.sh" script is contained within the scripts/ directory. (Note: it will need to be run in a directory containing both the VCF and the reference FASTA). Here's how to run it:
`bash get_fasta.sh`

This first bit of the output should look something like this:
```
Applied 0 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 3 variants
Applied 3 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 3 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 3 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 0 variants
Applied 4 variants
```
This is bcftools telling us how many sites in the reference FASTA it had to change in order to build each sample FASTA.

## Creating Multi-sample FASTA File
At this point, each sample (of which there are 67) should have its own FASTA file and within each FASTA file, the sequence should be divided up into 10 records that represent the 10 different exons in the PRDM9 CDS.

In order to perform the multiple sequence alignment, we need to merge FASTA records such that there is a single record for the full PRDM9 locus AND we need to pull all of the per-sample FASTA records into one single file to give to MUSCLE. In addition, we want to make sure that we preserve the identity of each sample so we need to include the sample name in the FASTA record. 

To perform this operation, move all of the FASTAs to their own directory (Note: in this repo it is the fastas/ directory) and run the combine_fastas.sh script in that directory. 
`bash combined_fastas.sh`

This should output a single FASTA named "combined_samples.fa". This file should contain 67 record, each of which represents the PRDM9 CDS for a single sample and whose header represents the sample name. Like this:
```
>Mmc_CAST10_H36.variant8_prdm9_cds.fa
AGTCAGAAATTCCTCACTCAACATATGGAATGGAATCATCGCACTGAAAT
CTTCCCAGGAACATCTGCAAGAATAAATCCTAAACCAGGAGATCCCTGTT

GCAATATTTCAGTGATAAGTCAAATGTCAATGAGCACCAGAAGACACACA
CAGGGGAGAAGCCCTATGTTTGCAGGGAGTGTGGGCGGGGCTTTACACAG
```

Now we are ready for the multiple sequence alignment!

## Generating Multiple Sequence Alignment with MUSCLE
To generate the multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE, run the following command on the FASTA file containing the combined samples.
```
muscle -in combined_samples.fa -phyi -out combined_samples.aln
```
This will produce an alignment in PHYLIP format within the "combined_samples.aln" file. The top of this output file should look like this:
```
67 2494
Ms_SPRE1_S AGTCAGAAAT TCCTCACTCA ACATATGGAA TGGAATCATC GCACTGAAAT
Ms_SPRE2_S AGTCAGAAAT TCCTCACTCA ACATATGGAA TGGAATCATC GCACTGAAAT
Ms_SPRE3_S AGTCAGAAAT TCCTCACTCA ACATATGGAA TGGAATCATC GCACTGAAAT
Ms_SPRE4_S AGTCAGAAAT TCCTCACTCA ACATATGGAA TGGAATCATC GCACTGAAAT

Mmm_AFG2_4 AGTCAGAAAT TCCTCACTCA ACATATGGAA TGGAATCATC GCACTGAAAT
```

Now we can input this multiple sequence alignment into IQ-TREE to start our phylogenetic tree estimation.

## Generating Phylogeny with IQ-TREE
To perform the phylogenetic tree construction using IQ-TREE, run the following command on the alignment file generated from the MUSCLE step.
```
iqtree -s combined_samples.aln -m MFP -b 100
```

This command strings together multiple of IQ-TREE's functions into a single line of code. The `-m MFP` argument tells IQ-TREE to use ModelFinderPlus to identify the best fit substitution model to use on the data. Then, IQ-TREE constructs a maximum likelihood tree from the alignment supplied by the `-s combined_samples.aln` argument using the best fit substitution model. After constructing the tree, the `-b 100` argument tells IQ-TREE to perform 100 non-parametric bootstrap replicates to evaluate branch supports. 

After running this command, IQ-TREE should direct a lot of output to the screen. Once it has finished running, the final bit of output should look like this.
```
Analysis results written to: 
  IQ-TREE report:                combined_samples.aln.iqtree
  Maximum-likelihood tree:       combined_samples.aln.treefile
  Likelihood distances:          combined_samples.aln.mldist
  Screen log file:               combined_samples.aln.log

Total CPU time for bootstrap: 172.855 seconds.
Total wall-clock time for bootstrap: 153.781 seconds.

Non-parametric bootstrap results written to:
Bootstrap trees:          combined_samples.aln.boottrees
  Consensus tree:           combined_samples.aln.contree
```
This tells us what is contained in the multiple output files that are produced by IQ-TREE.
